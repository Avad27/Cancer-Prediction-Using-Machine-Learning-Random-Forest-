# Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Random-Forest-
Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning (Random Forest) This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of cancer in patients based on clinical and diagnostic data. It uses the Random Forest algorithm, known for its high accuracy and robustness, to classify patient data as either benign or malignant.
